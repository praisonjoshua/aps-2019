There were three approaches discussed in class 
dp, recursion , optimised dp
dp - this was 2nd best with 2d matrix table being built 2 loops
recursion -  this looked easy but it is said that they consume more stack memory ..... and stuff.
optimised dp -  here the problem is solved using 1d array single lood
